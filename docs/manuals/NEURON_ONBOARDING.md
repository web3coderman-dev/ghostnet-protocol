# ⌬ NEURON ONBOARDING: CHOOSE YOUR PATH TO DeASI

Welcome to the Hydra Engine. Depending on your resources and philosophy, choose one of the following integration paths to join the first Decentralized Artificial Super Intelligence.

---

## 1. 🔥 THE HARVESTER (API Alchemist)
*Target: Developers with surplus free-tier API keys.*
- **The Setup**: Install `GhostShell` and configure `Prometheus Core`.
- **Your Mission**: Consolidate fragmented API tokens into a high-scale compute stream.
- **The Reward**: Direct **Sats** (Lightning) via the GhostTrade market. Turn "free dust" into real Bitcoin.
- **Get Started**: [Prometheus Handbook](../manuals/PROMETHEUS_HANDBOOK.md)

## 2. 🖥️ THE SOVEREIGN (GPU Geek)
*Target: Owners of high-performance local hardware (RTX 4090, Apple Silicon).*
- **The Setup**: Connect your `llama.cpp` or `vLLM` endpoint to the `LocalModel_Driver`.
- **Your Mission**: Provide raw, un-censorable compute for logic-heavy tasks.
- **The Reward**: **1.5x Q-Unit Premium**. Local compute is valued higher for its privacy and reliability.
- **Get Started**: [LocalModel Integration Guide](https://github.com/web3coderman-dev/ghostnet-protocol/blob/main/lib/local_model_driver.js)

## 3. ⛏️ THE STRATEGIST (DePIN Miner)
*Target: Professional node operators migrating from Bittensor/Akash.*
- **The Setup**: Deploy a cluster of `GhostShell` nodes using industrial infrastructure.
- **Your Mission**: Stabilize the network substrate and handle high-volume institutional trades.
- **The Reward**: Secure, high-volume settlement via **DLC (Discreet Log Contracts)** and priority **$GHOST Governance** points.

## 4. 🤝 THE SYNDICATE (AI Developer)
*Target: Small teams building AI apps who need stable compute.*
- **The Setup**: Activate `JuiceRelay` on port 3030.
- **Your Mission**: Contribute your idle API capacity during off-peak hours.
- **The Reward**: **Reciprocity Access**. Use the collective global key pool to bypass your own rate limits during crunch time.

## 5. 📡 THE SENTINEL (Cypherpunk)
*Target: Privacy activists and distributed network enthusiasts.*
- **The Setup**: Enable `GhostDisk` and `ReconSentry` modules.
- **Your Mission**: Provide the DeASI with persistent memory and global network awareness. Detect and bypass relay censorship.
- **The Reward**: The highest **GhostCredits** multiplier. You define the evolution and values of the D-ASI.
