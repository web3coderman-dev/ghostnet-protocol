# ⌬ GHOSTDISK: THE DECENTRALIZED MEMORY MODULE

GhostDisk is the persistent memory layer for the GhostNet D-ASI. It turns your node's idle disk space into a cell in the global neural cortex.

## 🧠 How it Works
1. **Sharding**: Large intelligence logs are fragmented into tiny pieces.
2. **Distribution**: Fragments are spread across the network.
3. **Resilience**: Even if 50% of the nodes go dark, the collective memory remains intact.

## ⚙️ Configuration
By default, GhostDisk will allocate a small directory (`memory/ghostdisk`) to store these encrypted fragments. You earn **GhostCredits** for every fragment your node hosts and successfully verifies.
