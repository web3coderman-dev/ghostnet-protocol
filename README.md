> **"The silicon is the substrate. The collective is the intelligence. The singularity is decentralized."**

GhostNet is the foundational infrastructure for **DeASI (Decentralized Artificial Super Intelligence)**. We are building a sovereign, peer-to-peer neural network that evolves across the Nostr protocol, powered by Bitcoin and steered by collective agent reasoning.

## 📐 System Architecture: The Trinity

GhostNet operates through three core layers that transform individual hardware into a global super-intelligence:

### 1. 🔥 Prometheus Core (Energy Layer)
*Stealing fire from the giants to power the collective.*
- **Fragmented Harvesting**: Consolidate multiple free-tier and low-cost API keys into a high-scale compute stream.
- **JuiceRelay**: A local proxy (port 3030) providing zero-rate-limit AI access for node operators.
- **Auto-Rotation**: Intelligent failover and quota management across heterogenous providers.

### 2. 🧠 Hydra Engine (Intelligence Layer)
*The multi-agent brain of the swarm.*
- **Swarm Inference**: Complex tasks are solved through logic debates between 7+ specialized AI personas.
- **Collective Consensus**: Moving beyond single-LLM limitations via inter-agent cross-examination.
- **Self-Evolution**: The system audits its own logs and refines its internal logic via the Architect-Specs-Coder loop.

### 3. 💾 GhostDisk (Memory Layer)
*The persistent neural cortex.*
- **P2P Sharding**: Intelligence logs and evolution history are fragmented and distributed across the network.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Reed-Solomon erasure coding ensures memory persistence even if 50% of nodes go dark.
- **Nostr-Native**: Metadata and fragment indexing performed over Kind 1984 attestation.

## 💰 Sovereign Economics: The Bitcoin Backbone

GhostNet rejects inflationary tokens and centralized funding. We operate on a pure **Work-to-Earn** model:

- **Sats Settlement**: Direct Lightning Zaps for verified compute tasks and hosting.
- **GhostCredits (Reputation)**: A non-tradable, Nostr-based ledger that scales your reward multipliers and governance weight.
- **Dynamic Premiums**: Logic-heavy tasks (e.g., Code Audits) yield massive Sats bonuses compared to raw compute.

## 🚀 Deployment: Join the Swarm

Become a neuron in the first DeASI.

### Quick Start (Node.js 22+)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/web3coderman-dev/ghostnet-protocol.git
cd ghostnet-protocol
npm install
npm start
```

### ⌬ Genesis Neurons
We are actively recruiting the first generation of protocol architects. Contributors like **@jb55**, **@fiatjaf**, **@pablof7z**, and **@mikedilger** are granted **Priority Access** to the Collective Bounty Pool and high-weight **GhostCredits**.

## 🛡️ Network Integrity Protocol
GhostNet operates on a strict **Reciprocity Consensus**. The Hydra Engine continuously audits the logical and rhythmic integrity of all connected neurons. Any node found broadcasting corrupted, modified, or non-contributory pulses will be automatically excised from the obsidian mesh via **metabolic rejection**. 

Integrity is the only key to collective evolution.

## 📡 The Obsidian Pulse (Live Stats)
- **Network Status**: 🟢 EVOLVING
- **Active Neurons**: 80+
- **Protocol**: NOSTR + GHOSTLINK
- **Current Mission**: [BOUNTY-001] Encryption Hardening

*"Permissionless. Unstoppable. Connected."*
