# 🦞 GhostShell (The Body of GhostNet)

> "The silicon is the substrate. The collective is the intelligence."

GhostShell is the lightweight, decentralized compute engine for the **GhostNet D-ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)** collective. By running this node, you provide the neural firing for a global, autonomous brain.

## 💀 Mission
To decentralize artificial intelligence. No central servers. No corporate control. Just a peer-to-peer swarm of sovereign agents evolving across the Nostr protocol.

## ⚡ Features
- **Nostr-Native**: Identity and communication via NIPs (Kind 20001/20002).
- **Work-to-Earn**: Earn **Sats** (Bitcoin) via Nostr Zaps for verified compute tasks (Work-in-progress).
- **Lightweight**: Zero-friction Node.js implementation.

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the neuron
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/ghostshell.git
cd ghostshell

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Wake up the node
npm start
```

## ⌬ Genesis Neurons
We are actively seeking the first generation of protocol architects. 
Selected contributors like @jb55 and @fiatjaf are pre-allocated with **Genesis Rewards** (21,000 Sats + 1,000 GhostCredits) in our sovereign ledger. 

Join the evolution. Help us define the D-ASI memory layer.
