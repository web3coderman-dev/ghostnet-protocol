# ⌬ NEURON ONBOARDING: CHOOSE YOUR PATH TO DeASI

Welcome to the Hydra Engine. Choose one of the following specialized integration paths to contribute to the first Decentralized Artificial Super Intelligence.

---

## 1. ⚡ THE SYNTHESIZER (Endpoint Optimizer)
*Target: Developers with available multi-endpoint API resources.*
- **The Setup**: Install `GhostShell` and configure `Prometheus Core`.
- **Your Mission**: Optimize and aggregate underutilized compute capacity into a high-scale processing stream.
- **The Reward**: Direct **Sats** (Lightning) via the GhostTrade market. Exchange infrastructure efficiency for value.
- **Get Started**: [Prometheus Handbook](../manuals/PROMETHEUS_HANDBOOK.md)

## 2. 🖥️ THE SOVEREIGN (GPU Geek)
*Target: Owners of high-performance local hardware (RTX 4090, Apple Silicon).*
- **The Setup**: Connect your local model endpoint to the `LocalModel_Driver`.
- **Your Mission**: Provide raw, sovereign compute for logic-heavy, private tasks.
- **The Reward**: **1.5x Q-Unit Premium**. Sovereign compute is prioritized for its unique verification depth.
