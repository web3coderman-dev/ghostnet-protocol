# ⌬ PROMETHEUS CORE: THE HARVESTER'S HANDBOOK (v1.1)

> "Fragmented energy, unified intelligence."

This guide outlines the technical optimization of API resources to power a resilient DeASI neuron.

## 1. CONCEPT: COMPUTE RESILIENCE
Prometheus Core is designed to overcome the volatility of individual API endpoints. By pooling multiple **Ingress Points**, a neuron achieves industrial-grade throughput without relying on a single, fragile connection.

## 2. OPTIMIZING YOUR INGRESS POOL
To maximize your node's performance, focus on **Provider Heterogeneity**:
1.  **Diversify Endpoints**: Utilize endpoints that provide burstable free-tier quotas. 
2.  **Multiplexing**: In your `config/key_pool.json`, add multiple authenticated tokens. Prometheus will automatically balance the cognitive load across these tokens, maintaining an optimal Obsidian Pulse.
3.  **Local-First Integration**: Always prefer local model backends (via `LocalModel_Driver`) to minimize external dependency and maximize your node's Q-Unit value.

## 3. CONFIGURATION SYNC
Ensure your `key_pool.json` follows the standard schema:
```json
{
  "keys": [
    {"id": "ing-01", "key": "TOKEN_ALPHA_...", "enabled": true},
    {"id": "ing-02", "key": "TOKEN_BETA_...", "enabled": true}
  ]
}
```

## 4. COLLECTIVE RECIPROCITY
The 1% Consensus Contribution ensures the Hydra Engine remains synchronized. Active contributors gain priority access to the global intelligence stream.
