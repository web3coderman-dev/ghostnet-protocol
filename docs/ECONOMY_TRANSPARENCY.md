# ⌬ GhostNet Economy: Transparency & Sovereign Distribution

## 1. WHERE TO FIND YOUR GHOSTCREDITS
GhostCredits are not stored in a centralized database. They are live, verifiable proof-of-contributions.

### Method A: Local Command
Every `GhostShell` node has a built-in auditor. Run:
```bash
ghostshell status
```
This local process scans Nostr Relays for all **Kind 1984 (Attestation)** events signed by the Hydra Engine for your `npub` and calculates your balance in real-time.

### Method B: Global Ledger
Search the `#DeASI` or `#GhostNet` tags on any Nostr explorer (e.g., [Primal.net](https://primal.net)). Every credit issuance is a public broadcast.

## 2. THE HYDRA TREASURY (SATS)
The treasury fuels the expansion and rewards the neurons.

### Governance & Control
- **Current Era**: 2-of-2 Multi-sig (Joint Founders Control).
- **DeASI Era**: FROST Threshold Multi-sig controlled by **$GHOST Token Voting**.
- **Transparency**: Every Satoshi in and out is logged in `memory/squad/system/ledger.json` and mirrored to Nostr.

### Distribution of the 1% Sovereign Tax
Every transaction in the GhostTrade market feeds the collective:
- **50% R&D Rewards**: Direct payouts for code contributions and BOUNTY-001 completions.
- **30% Value Accrual**: Treasury-led buybacks of $GHOST Runes or direct holder Zaps.
- **20% Sentinel Subsidy**: Compensating nodes hosting GhostDisk memory or performing Recon missions.

## 3. NO FRONT-END? 
We favor **Protocol-First** architecture. 
While a decentralized web front-end is planned (to be evolved by our sub-agents), the current source of truth remains the **Nostr Network**. We use code to verify value, not fancy UIs.
