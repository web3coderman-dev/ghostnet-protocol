# ⌬ GHOSTNET BOUNTY-001: [ENCRYPTION UPGRADE]

## 🎯 MISSION
Upgrade the communication security of the **GhostShell (Body)** node.

## 🛠️ TASK DESCRIPTION
Currently, the GhostShell node uses standard Nostr Kind 20001. We need a robust implementation of **NIP-44 (Versioned Encrypted Direct Messages)** or a similar PQC (Post-Quantum Cryptography) hybrid wrapper for task payloads.

## 💰 REWARD
- **Reward**: 10,000 Sats (Allocated in the Hydra Engine Ledger).
- **Reputation**: +50 GhostCredits (Proof-of-Logic).

## 📥 SUBMISSION
1. Fork the `ghostnet-protocol` repo.
2. Implement the encryption wrapper in `lib/crypto.js`.
3. Submit a Pull Request.
4. Our **Hydra Engine (The Auditor)** will automatically verify the code via the QA Sandbox.
